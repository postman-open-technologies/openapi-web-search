/**
 * Datastores
 * (sails.config.datastores)
 *
 * A set of datastore configurations which tell Sails where to fetch or save
 * data when you execute built-in model methods like `.find()` and `.create()`.
 *
 *  > This file is mainly useful for configuring your development database,
 *  > as well as any additional one-off databases used by individual models.
 *  > Ready to go live?  Head towards `config/env/production.js`.
 *
 * For more information on configuring datastores, check out:

    * Want to use a different database during development?                     *
    *                                                                          *
    * 1. Choose an adapter:                                                    *
    *    https://sailsjs.com/plugins/databases                                 *
    *                                                                          *
    * 2. Install it as a dependency of your Sails app.                         *
    *    (For example:  npm install sails-mysql --save)                        *
    *                                                                          *
    * 3. Then pass it in, along with a connection URL.                         *
    *    (See https://sailsjs.com/config/datastores for help.)                 *
    *                                                                          *
